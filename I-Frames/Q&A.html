                    <!-- Question  -->
                    <h2>What is the dress code?</h2>
                    <p>While our dress code is semi-formal, what we really want is for you to wear something that
                        makes you feel confident and ready to party. Don’t feel obliged to shop – we’d love it if you wear
                        something you already own. Dressing to theme is not required, but for those who would like to, our
                        colours are deep green and gold.</p>
                    <h2>Would you like gifts?</h2>
                    <p>We are not opening a registry. For anyone who would like to bring a gift, we would love a
                        thoughtfully chosen Christmas bauble. That way, every year we will be able to reminisce as we
                        decorate. We would also love any contributions to our honeymoon fund, although we stress that this
                        is not expected of anyone.</p>
                    <!-- Question  -->
                    <h2>What is the entertainment?</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the wedding, you will find party games hidden in various locations. Finding these
                        is half the fun! From 8pm, we will have live music in the bar provided by the one and only <a href="https://www.fivechambersfull.com/">Five
                        Chambers Full</a> and DJ sets from our favourite No Wave alumni. For
                        those who prefer a quieter evening, we will have board games and art supplies set up in the barn –
                        perfect for kids and adults. We will also have a photo booth set up in the bar throughout the day.
