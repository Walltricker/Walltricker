                    <h1>Details of the Event</h1>
                    <p>The Wedding of William and Sapphire will take place on the 02 November 2024 at the Moat Farmhouse
                    </p>
                    <h2>Venue</h2>
                    <p>The Moat is a Kent farmhouse with a beautiful 14th century barn. It is in the village of Wrotham,
                        which sits along Pilgrim’s Way and along the edge of the North Downs. We love the low beams,
                        Tudor panelling, and open fires – a perfect cosy winter pub environment! For our wedding, we
                        have exclusive access to the barn, attached bar, and a small private garden. The rest of the pub
                        and the main garden will remain open to members of the public, and dogs are welcome in those
                        areas – but not in the wedding! The garden has space heaters, and there are outdoor nooks
                        available for anyone needing a quiet moment. Parking is free, although you will have to enter
                        your registration at the door.</p>
