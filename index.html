                                <br />
                                <p>The Moat is a Kent farmhouse with a beautiful 14th century barn in the village of
                                    Wrotham, which sits along Pilgrim’s Way and along the edge of the North Downs. We
                                    love the low
                                    beams,
                                    Tudor panelling, and open fires – a perfect cosy winter pub environment! For our
                                    wedding, we
                                    have
                                    exclusive access to the barn, attached bar, and a small private garden. The rest of
                                    the pub and
                                    the main
                                    garden will remain open to members of the public, and dogs are welcome in those
                                    areas – but not
                                    in the
                                    wedding! The garden has space heaters, and there are outdoor nooks available for
                                    anyone needing
                                    a quiet

                                    hikes in the beautiful Surrey Downs, and spent plenty of time at the pub. Six months
                                    later they moved in together during lockdown. Will taught Sapph how to play video
                                    games, and she taught him more about quantum physics than he wanted to know.
                                    Luckily, this brought them closer together.<br /></p>

                                    <p>When they moved to Cambridge in 2022, Will decided the time had come to propose. He
                                    stayed with Sapph’s parents under the guise of having a study break and, while
                                    there, talked with Sapph’s mum about designing a ring with specially chosen stones. <br /></p>

                                    <p>He proposed on their first Christmas together in Cambridge. Sapph was thrilled to
                                    say yes, although this was before she appreciated how much work planning a wedding
                                    would entail.<br /></p>

                                    <p>These days, they are kept busy by two cats, attending festivals and gigs, improving
                                    their chess and squash games, and exploring the pubs of Cambridge. <br /></p>

                                <h2>What is the dress code?</h2>
                                <p>While our dress code is semi-formal, what we really want is for you to wear something
                                    that
                                    makes you feel confident and ready to party. Don’t feel obliged to shop – we’d love
                                    it if you wear
                                    something you already own. Dressing to theme is not required, but for those who
                                    would like to, our
                                    colours are deep green and gold.</p>
                                <h2>Would you like gifts?</h2>
                                <p>We are not opening a registry. For anyone who would like to bring a gift, we would
                                    love a
                                    thoughtfully chosen Christmas bauble. That way, every year we will be able to
                                    reminisce as we
                                    decorate. We would also love any contributions to our honeymoon fund, although we
                                    stress that this
                                    is not expected of anyone.</p>

                                <p>Throughout the wedding, you will find party games hidden in various locations.
                                    Finding these
                                    is half the fun! From 8pm, we will have live music in the bar provided by the one
                                    and only <a href="https://www.fivechambersfull.com/">Five
                                        Chambers Full</a> and DJ sets from our favourite No Wave alumni. For
                                    those who prefer a quieter evening, we will have board games and art supplies set up
                                    in the barn –
                                    perfect for kids and adults. We will also have a photo booth set up in the bar
                                    throughout the day.
